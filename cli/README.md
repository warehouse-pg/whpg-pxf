# `pxf cluster` CLI

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you are set up for PXF development by following the README.md at the root of this repository. This tool requires Go version 1.21 or higher. Follow the directions [here](https://golang.org/doc/) to get the language set up.

1. Run the tests
   ```
   make test
   ```

1. Build the CLI
   ```
   make
   ```
   This will put the binary `pxf-cli` into `pxf/cli/build/`. You can also install the binary into `${PXF_HOME}/bin/pxf-cli` with:
   ```
   make install
   ```

1. There is also end to end testing for the pxf-cli located at `pxf/concourse/scripts/cli`. These tests were historically run via the Concourse `dev` pipeline (`MULTINODE=true make -C ~/workspace/pxf/concourse dev`). That Concourse tooling is deprecated and targets infrastructure that is no longer accessible (see [`concourse/README.md`](../concourse/README.md)); the live CI surface is the GitHub Actions workflows under `whpg-extensions-packaging/.github/workflows/`.

## Debugging the CLI on a live system

Because it's hard to mock out a Greenplum cluster, it's useful to debug on a real live cluster. We can do this using the [`delve`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) project.

1. Install `dlv` command, see [here](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/Documentation/installation/linux/install.md) for more details:

```bash
go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest
```

2. Optionally create a file with a list of commands, this could be useful to save you from re-running commands. You can actually run them with the `source` command in the `dlv` REPL:

```
config max-string-len 1000
break cluster/cluster.go:216
continue
print commands
```

3. Run the `dlv` command to enter the interactive REPL:

```bash
cd ~/workspace/pxf/cli
GPHOME=/usr/local/greenplum-db dlv debug pxf-cli -- cluster restart
```

The [help page for dlv](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/cli) is useful.

## IDE Setup (GoLand)
* Start GoLand. Click "Open" and select the cli folder inside the pxf repo.
* Open preferences/settings and set under GO > GoPath, set Project GoPath to ~/workspace/pxf/cli/go or the equivalent.
* Under GO > Go Modules, select the enable button and leave the environment field empty.
* Check that it worked by running a test file (ex: go test pxf-cli/cmd)
